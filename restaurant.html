    <p>produce locally to be used in reimagined classic dishes. With the bountiful waters of the coast a literal stone’s throw away, fish naturally takes pride of place, with everything from tender sautéed squid to lobster spaghetti showing up on the menu. The best cuts of locally sourced meat are also well-represented in carefully considered dishes such as pistachio-crusted rack of lamb and Marsala-marinated beef. Multi-course tasting menus serve as a platform for the kitchen team to showcase their culinary vision with vegetarian tasting menu options available for non-meat eaters. Sommeliers are also on-hand to help diners pick the perfect accompaniment from the extensive collection of Italian and international wines.</p>
